# Univerze_website
The website is designed to help international students to get to know the culture and way around in Melbourne. It was created using Next.js as the complete API router and React.js along with its MUI, DaisyUI and Tailwind css libraries to create the front-end side. A number of open data sources and public API were used, such as TicketmasterAPI, VICSuburb/LocalityBoundaries, RentalReport, etc. The project was completed in a total of 3 iterations with a number of Epics, each contributing progressively towards refining features and enhancing overall functionality. The website was hosted using vercel.
